## Here we are setup a minor node js project in Microservices architecture style

## Introduction

`what are microservices ?`

`Microservices - also known as the microservice architecture - is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services`

`what are Api Gateways ?`

`An application programming interface (API) gateway is software that takes an application userâ€™s request, routes it to one or more backend services, gathers the appropriate data and delivers it to the user in a single, combined package. It also provides analytics, layers of threat protection and other security for the application.`


`Here we have create two services and connect`


`1.user : In this service we have create user signup , login and userDetails Api inside user/src`

`2.order  : In this service we have create user's order add ,orderDetail and orderList Api inside order/src`

## In Api Gateway
`import { check_auth } from '../api_gateway/utils/authentication'`

`import { connect } from '../api_gateway/utils/database'`

`connect();`

`const server = gateway({`

    `routes: [
    //Here User service call
        {
            prefix: '/User',
            // auth: auth,
            target: 'http://localhost:3000',
        },
        //Here Order services call
        {
            prefix: '/Order',
            target: 'http://localhost:3001',
            middlewares: [check_auth]
        }
    ]
});`
